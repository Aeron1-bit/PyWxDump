      "username": "your_username",
      "password": "your_password"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Extract Data

Run the extraction script to pull data from your WeChat accounts.

```bash
python extract.py
```

### Step 3: Export Data

Once you have extracted the data, you can export it to your desired format. Use the following command:

```bash
python export.py --format csv
```

Replace `csv` with `html` or any other supported format as needed.

## Data Formats

### CSV

The CSV format is ideal for data analysis. You can open it in spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
